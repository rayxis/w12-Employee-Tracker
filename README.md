Week 12 - Employee Tracker

## Description

The Employee Tracker is a command-line application designed to help business owners manage their company's departments,
roles, and employees. By providing a user-friendly interface, the app allows the user to view all departments, roles,
and employees. It also supports adding, deleting and updating those same tables.

## Installation

To install the Employee Tracker, you'll need to clone the repository to your local environment and then run npm install
to install all necessary dependencies. Beyond that, you'll also want to make sure that you do have MySQL (or MariaDB)
installed, and that you have write access to a database. You can find a schema.sql file that can be run to build the 
database for you, in the `db` folder. The database is named `dieArbeit` (*the work* in German), but can be named 
something else more fitting for your purposes.

Use the following command to clone the repository:

```shell
git clone <repository_url>
```
Then move into the cloned directory and install the dependencies:

```shell
cd <repository_name>
npm install
```
## Usage

### Execution

To run the Employee Tracker application, use the following command in your terminal:

```shell
npm start
```

### Demonstration

A video demonstration of the application can be found here: 

### Future Plans

Future versions of this application should include additional checks on data inputs, better formatting and functions 
to improve the workflow.
